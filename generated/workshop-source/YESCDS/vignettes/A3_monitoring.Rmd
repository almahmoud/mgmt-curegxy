# Variation in cancer rates, recorded at the county level

We focus on colorectal cancer:

# Exercises

A.3.1  Use [State Cancer Profiles](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/map/map.noimage.php) to produce
a map of colorectal cancer incidence for Massachusetts.  You will have to
make selections in the web interface.  Choose the Quantiles interval type with 8 intervals.
Obtain the map for both sexes, all ages.  What is the county with lowest incidence of colorectal cancer?

A.3.2 True or false: In Massachusetts, the age-adjusted incidence of colorectal cancer for individuals
greater than 65 years of age is approximately ten times that of individuals less than 50 years of age.

A.3.3 Return to cancers of colon and rectum.  Form a map for Area "United States", Area Type "By State".
Limit to age less than 50.  Which state has the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in this age group?

A.3.4 Data presented by the Environmental Protection Agency can be seen
at [Exhibit 5 of the current Report on the Environment](https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/indicator.cfm?i=73#5).
What is the estimated incidence rate for colorectal cancer for females in 2017 (end of the
curve)?  How does this compare to the "State Cancer Profile" statistic for females of all ages?

A.3.5 Using the EPA chart in Exhibit 5, which type of cancer in females shows a steady decrease
in incidence from 2000 to 2017?
