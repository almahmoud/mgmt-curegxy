# Cancer experiences: a personal view

In 60 years of life I have been cancer-free, but many family members and
friends have had to address the disease.

I prepared a table with some information on contacts whose cancer
experiences I know of:

    datatable(vjc_cancer_net)

Note that the table can be sorted and searched. You can also alter the
number of records presented.
