# Clinical trials for cancer treatments

-   Despite massive investments in cancer research and treatment
    development, cancer remains a leading cause of death

-   We have examined many aspects of cancer’s diversity

    -   tissue of origin
    -   somatic mutations
    -   response to treatment

-   The main modalities of medical response to cancer are

    -   surgery
    -   chemotherapy
    -   radiation

-   Each of these modalities has a collection of subtypes, and they are
    often used in combination

-   How do doctors and patients navigate the available options?

    -   Answer: interpret available data as evidence in favor of or
        against certain options

-   The “gold standard” for evidence in medical decisionmaking is the
    randomized clinical trial (RCT)

    -   Trials are generally preceded by “pre-clinical” studies of drugs
        or other treatment techniques
    -   Analysis of data in pre-clinical research often demands great
        versatility of the statisticians and data scientists
        -   such data are often sparse and noisy
        -   ideally one integrates all available scientific information
            about the proposed alternative, requiring extensive
            literature search and acquisition of public data

# Questions to answer in designing a clinical trial [(Article)](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/what-you-need-to-know/phases-of-clinical-trials.html)

D.1.1 What is the current standard of care?

D.1.2 What care outcomes do we want to improve, and how much improvement
would count as a real advance? (Here risk-benefit comparison becomes
important)

D.1.3 What is the proposed alternative?

D.1.4 How do we determine a safe “dose” of the proposed alternative? (In
the case of surgery this question may not make sense)

D.1.5 How do we verify that the proposed alternative has any effect at
all?

D.1.6 How do we measure the overall benefit conferred by using the
alternative method?

# The typical strategy: Three phases

-   Phase I: enroll healthy volunteers to do dose finding, assessing
    toxicity and side effects
-   Phase II: enroll patients with the disease and administer the
    maximum tolerated dose to establish that the new treatment has some
    beneficial effect
-   Phase III: enroll patients with the disease, but set up a comparison
    of the new treatment versus the standard of care
    -   a design plan is produced detailing how many patients are to be
        enrolled, how the treatments will be administered, and how the
        data will be analyzed
    -   patients are randomly assigned either the new treatment, or the
        standard of care
    -   a Data Safety Monitoring Board will review study data
        periodically
        -   studies may end prematurely if great benefit is seen early
            on, or if it appears no benefit could be documented by
            continuing the trial

# Experimentation with human subjects is carefully regulated

The concept of [informed
consent](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/what-you-need-to-know/what-does-a-clinical-trial-involve.html)
is central in the implementation of clinical trials.

The [Belmont
report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html)
defined principles and guidelines for all human subjects research.
